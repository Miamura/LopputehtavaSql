How gold is graded :

Karat Grading: This indicates the purity of gold and is represented by "K" or "kt." The higher the karat, the purer the gold. Common karat grades are:

24K (24 Karat): 99.9% pure gold (purest form of gold)
22K (22 Karat): 91.6% pure gold
18K (18 Karat): 75% pure gold
14K (14 Karat): 58.5% pure gold
10K (10 Karat): 41.7% pure gold
9K (9 Karat): 37.5% pure gold
As purity decreases, gold becomes more durable but also less valuable.

Purity Hallmarking System: Similar to the karat grading system, some countries use a "fineness" or hallmark rating to show the purity of gold. It is graded as follows:

999 Fineness: 24K, 99.9% pure gold
916 Fineness: 22K, 91.6% pure gold
750 Fineness: 18K, 75% pure gold
585 Fineness: 14K, 58.5% pure gold
375 Fineness: 9K, 37.5% pure gold
Gold Color Grading: The color of gold is determined by the type and proportion of other metals alloyed with it, not by purity. Common gold colors include:

Yellow Gold: Classic gold color, achieved by alloying with silver and copper.
White Gold: Created with platinum, nickel, or palladium alloys and often rhodium-plated for extra shine.
Rose Gold: Has a pink hue, achieved by adding copper to the alloy.
Green Gold: A lighter greenish color, created by alloying with silver and sometimes zinc.
These gradings are typically marked with a stamp or hallmark on gold jewelry to indicate its purity and type.

Whats the mean "4Cs" of a diamond :

Carat: This is the weight of the diamond, abbreviated as "ct." For example, “1.00 ct” means one carat. As carat weight increases, so do the size and value of the diamond.

Cut: This represents the quality of the diamond's cut, which affects its brilliance and sparkle. Cut quality is graded as "Excellent," "Very Good," "Good," "Fair," and "Poor." The cut also includes the shape of the diamond, such as round, princess, oval, or emerald cut.

Color: The color of a diamond is graded from "D" (colorless, highest quality) to "Z" (light yellow). Grades D-F are colorless, G-J are nearly colorless, and K-Z show increasingly visible yellow or brown tints.

Clarity: This measures the presence of natural inclusions or blemishes within the diamond. According to the GIA clarity scale:

FL (Flawless): No inclusions or blemishes visible
IF (Internally Flawless): No internal inclusions
VVS1 & VVS2 (Very Very Slightly Included): Minute inclusions
VS1 & VS2 (Very Slightly Included): Minor inclusions
SI1 & SI2 (Slightly Included): Noticeable inclusions
I1, I2, I3 (Included): Inclusions visible to the naked eye
These qualities are usually shown on a diamond certificate or grading report, which indicates the diamond’s overall quality.
